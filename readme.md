# Simple Auth Server

### Overview

The Simple Auth Server is a lightweight, open-source project built using TypeScript, Fastify, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), PostgreSQL, and encrypted password storage. It provides a simple yet robust authentication solution for web applications.

## Features

-   **Fastify Framework:** Utilizes Fastify, a fast and low overhead web framework for Node.js, ensuring high performance and scalability.
-   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Implements JWT-based authentication, offering secure token-based authentication for users.
-   **PostgreSQL Database:** Integrates PostgreSQL as the database backend, providing reliable storage for user authentication data.
-   **File System Router and Prehandlers:** Implements a flexible file system-based routing mechanism and prehandlers to handle various request validations and processing.
-   **Password Encryption:** Ensures secure storage of user passwords by encrypting them before storing in the database.

## How it works

-   **User Authentication:** Users can authenticate themselves using JWT tokens generated by the server upon successful login.
-   **Database Integration:** User authentication data, including usernames, encrypted passwords, and other relevant information, is stored securely in a PostgreSQL database.
-   **Token-based Access Control:** JWT tokens are used to grant access to protected routes and resources, providing a secure and efficient method of authentication.
-   **Flexible Routing:** The server utilizes a file system-based router to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate handlers and prehandlers for validation and processing.

## Getting Started & Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will require to install Node.js to compile run this script

To get started with the Simple Auth Server:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
1. Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn. eg: `npm install`
1. Check out `src/config.ts` and configure it with your secret keys and database configuration
1. Run `npm test` to compile, run and start authenticating users securely! :D

> [!TIP]
> Enhance your development experience in Visual Studio Code by installing the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension. With this extension, you can seamlessly make API requests directly from your IDE. Explore the pre-configured API requests available in the `apicalls.rest` file for convenient testing and validation of your APIs
